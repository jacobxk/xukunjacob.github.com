I am a PhD candidate in the field of educational measurement, or say   psychometrics. My research insterests are Rasch measurment, item response theory, multilevel analysis. You can download my [**Curriculum vitae**](/CV.pdf) for more information about my research.



I enjoy programming when there are simulation studies in my research and thus I guess I will gradually become a programmer in the future. In my opinion, the most beautiful phrase is "YOU NEVER KNOW". Ya, I never know where I will reach but it is not a excuse to give up.
