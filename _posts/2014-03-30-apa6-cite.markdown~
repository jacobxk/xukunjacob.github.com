I was trying to writing my thesis with Sweave with R and compile it with knitr. Everything went smoothly except the citation. The default ```bibtex``` did not support the APA format satisfatraly without some packages like ```apacite```. However, the ```apacite``` was no longer in an active development status and it was not support the APA 6 formation.

I digged in the Stack Exchange and found that there are two package recently available for the APA 6 format citation. One is ```apa6``` and the other is ```biblatex-apa```. 

A short sample on the ```apa6``` package presented as the following.

    \documentclass{apa6}
    \usepackage[american]{babel}
    \usepackage{csquotes}
    \usepackage[style=apa,sortcites=true,sorting=nyt,backend=biber]{biblatex}
    \DeclareLanguageMapping{american}{american-apa}

    \addbibresource{ref.bib}

    \usepackage{color}
    \usepackage[colorlinks=true]{hyperref}

    \begin{document}

    Text is here\parencite{Reise2012}.
    \textcite{Briggs2013a} claimed something.
    
    \nocite{*}
    \printbibliography

    \end{document}


And a short sample on the ```biblatex-apa``` package presneted as the following.
