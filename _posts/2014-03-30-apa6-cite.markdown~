I was trying to draft my thesis with Sweave with R and compile it with knitr. Everything went smoothly except the citation. The default ```bibtex``` did not support the APA format satisfatraly without some packages like ```apacite```. However, the ```apacite``` was no longer in an active development status and it was not support the APA 6 formation.

I digged in the Stack Exchange and found that there are two package recently available for the APA 6 format citation. One is ```apa6``` and the other is ```biblatex-apa```. 

A short sample with the ```apa6``` package presented as the following.

    \documentclass{apa6}
    \usepackage[american]{babel}
    \usepackage{csquotes}
    \usepackage[style=apa,sortcites=true,sorting=nyt,backend=biber]{biblatex}
    \DeclareLanguageMapping{american}{american-apa}

    \addbibresource{ref.bib}

    \usepackage{color}
    \usepackage[colorlinks=true]{hyperref}

    \begin{document}

    Text is here\parencite{Reise2012}.
    \textcite{Briggs2013a} claimed something.
    
    \nocite{*}
    \printbibliography

    \end{document}

And here is a short sample with the ```biblatex-apa``` package.

    \documentclass{article}
    \usepackage[american]{babel}
    \usepackage{csquotes}
    \usepackage[style=apa]{biblatex}

    \DeclareLanguageMapping{english}{american-apa}

    \usepackage{color}
    \usepackage[colorlinks=true]{hyperref}

    \addbibresource{ref.bib}

    \begin{document}

    Text is here\parencite{Reise2012}.
    \textcite{Briggs2013a} claimed something.

    \nocite{*}
    \printbibliography

    \end{document}

The only difference between this two packages on this short sample is that the ```\documentclass{}``` argument. The former fixed on a layout design specific for APA journal format or manuscript, while the later standed on the ```\LaTeX``` general layout and the article, report or books can be used for different purpose. Thus, the former might be more appropriate for manuscript preparation and the later for thesis.

However, both of these two packages depenced on the ```biblatex``` package. The ```biblatex``` manual offered different document classes for purposes. Thus, it might be possible to release the restrition of document class by ```apa6```.

---------------------------------------------------------------

There is also a note on the package installations. That is, the ```biber``` has became the most popular backend for ```biblatex``` while the Ubuntu cran seems did not catch up with the newly upgrades. According to the official website, the current ```biber``` version is 1.8 now but the version obtained via ```apt-get``` is still 0.9.9. So a manual installation is needed. The same requirement also occured on the ```biblatex-apa``` package.
